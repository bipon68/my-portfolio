<p>Step 1 - I created my updated personal site using React to create components from the data in my JSON resume file and render each component as a single page application. 
Step 2 - The first step was to create my resume in the JSON Resume Schema format (<a href="https://jsonresume.org/">https://jsonresume.org/</a>), I then loaded this JSON file into the main app.js file and passed each individual section as a prop to the individual React components. </p>
<p>Noted: I compiled the jsx files using Babel.</p>
