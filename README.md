# React-Resume

Step 1 - I created my updated personal site using React to create components from the data in my JSON resume file and render each component as a single page application. 
Step 2 - The first step was to create my resume in the JSON Resume Schema format (https://jsonresume.org/), I then loaded this JSON file into the main app.js file and passed each individual section as a prop to the individual React components. 

Noted: I compiled the jsx files using Babel.
